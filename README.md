# Mobile Application: FinApp
An application to track monthly expenses on any daily purchases and monthly subscriptions. Inspired by the book "Rich Dad Poor Dad", I created this application with features that are customized to my need. So far this application has helped me actively keep track of my expenses and help me grow financially in savings.
